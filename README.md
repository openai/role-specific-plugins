# Role-Specific Plugins

Role-specific plugins make Codex easier to customize for a team's day-to-day work.
These templates package domain-specific skills, connector bindings, and starter
assets so teams can adapt Codex for roles like sales, data analytics, and product
design. They were built with OpenAI subject matter
experts around workflows that are already helping teams move faster internally
and with alpha partners. Over the coming weeks, we'll continue expanding this
collection with more roles, workflows, and examples.

The plugins are intended to be customized before use. Connector-backed plugins
may include placeholder app and connector ids that must be replaced with ids
available to the target workspace.

## Repository Layout

```text
.
|-- .agents/plugins/marketplace.json
`-- plugins/
    |-- sales/
    |-- data-analytics/
    `-- product-design/
```

Each plugin generally follows this structure:

```text
plugins/plugin-name/
|-- .codex-plugin/plugin.json   # Plugin manifest and display metadata
|-- .app.json                   # App and connector bindings, when needed
|-- .mcp.json                   # MCP server configuration, when needed
|-- skills/                     # Workflow instructions and domain context
|-- assets/                     # Icons, templates, and examples
`-- README.md                   # Plugin-specific notes, when present
```

## Configure Connectors

Connector-backed plugins declare app bindings in `.app.json`. Some bindings use
placeholder ids:

```json
{
  "apps": {
    "salesforce": {
      "id": "REPLACE_WITH_SALESFORCE_APP_OR_CONNECTOR_ID"
    }
  }
}
```

Before installing a connector-backed plugin, replace each placeholder with a
matching app or connector id available to your workspace.

| Placeholder | Replace with |
| --- | --- |
| `REPLACE_WITH_SALESFORCE_APP_OR_CONNECTOR_ID` | Salesforce or Agentforce Sales |
| `REPLACE_WITH_SITES_APP_OR_CONNECTOR_ID` | Sites |

Canonical shared platform connector ids and existing `templated_apps_*` template
registry ids are portable bindings and should be left unchanged. Do not copy
other app or connector ids from another workspace unless their availability
across workspaces is documented.

If a plugin lists an optional app that your workspace does not use, remove that
app binding before installing the plugin.
